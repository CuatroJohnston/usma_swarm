To work, must install simplekml python module. In terminal run 2 commands:
1: `curl https://raw.github.com/pypa/pip/master/contrib/get-pip.py | sudo python`
2: `pip install simplekml`

Recommend copying script to other directory on computer to use without messing with GIT everytime waypoints are changed.
