READ ME: AP_ENUMERATIONS.PY
Andrew Kopeikin - 18 Oct 17

The ap_enumerations.py needs to be updated based on the location.  
Open the file and update parameter SITL_LOCATION to 0,1,..., based on the enumerated locations.
Then copy this file over in /home/user1/ACS/acs_ros_ws/src/autonomy-payload/ap_lib/src/ap_lib

If running the SITL, this is all that is required.
If conducting a flight mission, the acs_ros_ws directory will be loaded into the vehicles per setup procedures.

The original downloaded (vetted) ap_enumerations.py is in the "original" folder.
It only includes the California location. 

Past used ap_enumerations.py are in the "archive" folder
